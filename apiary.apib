# Group Events
Events are the most important aspect of MatchUp. Users can create Events complete with their own set of rules, logo, banner, registration deadlines, etc. These Events feature Tournaments where other users compete against one
another in their favourite video games. Events may be hosted by Organizations. For now on, we'll call them Hosted Events when they are hosted by an Organization and Regular Events when not.
Hosted Events have extra features like multiple Tournaments, featuring of Sponsors, etc.

## All Events [/matchup/events{?type,filter,value,state,hosted}]
Act on all Events in the system. Events can be serched and filtered by various fields.

### Get All Events [GET]
+ Parameters
    + type (optional, string) ... The type of Event.
    
        Events can be created/organized by a single customer or can be hosted by an organization. Organizations represent any group of people or “real world organizations” that would like to host Events.
        If an Event isn't hosted by an Organization it is denominated as a Regular Event.
        + Values
            + `regular`
            + `hosted`
            
    + filter (optional, string) ... Filter Events by the games that are played or by a genre of games.
        
        Events are composed of Tournaments where players compete in a specific Game. These Games are of specific Genres. After setting the value for the filter, you should specify the value of the filter (see below).
        + Values
            + `game`
            + `genre`
            
    + value (optional, string, `DOTA 2`) ... The value for the filter.
        
        Look for Events with Tournamnets that feature a specific game or games from a specific genre. If the filter is set (i.e., game) and the value is not specified the result will be an empty array.

    + state (optional, string) ... Filter Events by their current state.
        
        Indicate if the list of Events will show only ongoing Events, upcoming Events, or past Events.
        + Values
            + `live`
            + `past`
            + `upcoming`

# Group Stations
A station is where a match takes place. Hosted Events may have multiple stations, while Regular Events have none. 
Real world stations in eSports are usually composed of a surface (table, desk, etc.) where a console/pc is set and runs a game. 
Sometimes the matches played in specific stations are streamed online for the fans to watch at home.
Stations may be shared between multiple Tournaments within the same Event.

## All Stations [/matchup/events/{event}/stations{?date,location,station}]
Act on all stations of a Hosted Event.
